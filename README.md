# Family Calendar Planner - Frontend

This project is a Family Calendar application built using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.6. It is designed to help families keep track of their schedules and events in a user-friendly and efficient manner.

## Features

- **Event Management**: Create, edit, and delete events.
- **Calendar View**: Monthly, weekly, and daily views of events.

## Backend

This project requires a backend server to function correctly. The backend repository can be found at [aspnet-family-calendar](https://github.com/Edu-Fortes/aspnet-family-calendar). Please follow the instructions in the backend repository to set it up.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: Front-end framework
- **TypeScript**: Programming language
- **HTML & CSS**: Markup and styling
